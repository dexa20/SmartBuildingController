# 🏢 Controller for UCLan SmartBuilding 🏢

This project is an assessment task for the second-year students of the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan). The objective is to convert the C&T building into a "Smart Building" 🌐 controlled by a custom-written application. The initial phase focuses on developing a system to manage doors 🚪, lights 💡, and fire alarms 🔔 within the building. This project emphasizes the use of C#, the NUnit 3 testing framework, and adheres to a test-driven development (TDD) methodology, incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
